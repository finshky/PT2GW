Given a scalar potential, PT2GW searches for 1^st-order, thermal phase transitions and computes gravitational wave spectra.
The package relies on [FindBounce](https://github.com/vguada/FindBounce) to compute the Euclidean bounce action.
To construct effective potential in the dimensional reduction approach, a simple interface with [DRalgo](https://github.com/DR-algo/DRalgo) is provided.

To install, download the latest .paclet file and run
```PacletInstall["path/to/PT2GW.paclet-x.y.z"]```
substituting the appropriate `path/to/` and `x.y.z` version.
